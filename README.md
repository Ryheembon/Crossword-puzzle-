# Crossword-puzzle-
This project implements a dynamic crossword puzzle generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application creates a 15x15 grid where words are randomly placed either horizontally or vertically. After placing the words, any remaining empty cells are filled with random letters to complete the grid. The project allows users to generate a new crossword puzzle with a single click. The design leverages modern web technologies to create a simple and interactive crossword experience. It demonstrates how basic JavaScript logic can be applied to manipulate the DOM and generate random content within a structured layout. The project can be further expanded to include features like puzzle-solving hints, interactive word clues, and improved UI for a more engaging user experience.
